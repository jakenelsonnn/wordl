#Wordl: A Wordle-like game for Android

###About
I made this because I really like solving the NYT's Wordle game but don't want to have to do one per day. I also wanted to add more features,
such as the option to play four or six letter games as opposed to the standard five.

###Development
This app was developed in Android Studio and coded in Java.

####Resources
For the words for the four and six letter games, I used this wordlist:

For the graphing features, I used this library.

###Installation
Download wordl.apk from this repository onto your Android and open it to install it. You may need to go to your Settings to allow permission
for the app to be installed.
